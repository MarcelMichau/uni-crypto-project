The AES algorithm is based on permutations and substitutions.

The following steps are performed:

1.  KeyExpansion — round keys are derived from the cipher key using Rijndael's key schedule.

2.  InitialRound
AddRoundKey — each byte of the state is combined with the round key using bitwise xor.

3.  Rounds
SubBytes — a non-linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a lookup table.
ShiftRows — a transposition step where each row of the state is shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.
MixColumns — a mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.
