The transposition algorithm works by taking an input string and a comma-seperated key that specifies the order of the columns to output.

For example, the key 1,3,4,2 will print the columns in the following order:

First column
Third column
Fourth column
Second column

The algorithm then transposes the characters in table according to the specified key and prints them in the specified order.
