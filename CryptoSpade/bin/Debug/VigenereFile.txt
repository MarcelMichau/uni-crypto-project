The Vigenere Tableau cipher takes an input file and a string key.

The file is then encrypted by using each character of the key as a Caesar algorithm substitute to shift the bytes in the original file.

To decrypt, the key is used to subtract the shifted byte amount from the decrypted file to retrieve the original file.
