The Vernam Algorithm works by taking an input string and key, then converting each character to a numerical value. 
 
The key must be the same length as the input string.  

The algorithm then performs an XOR operation on the characters in the input string with the characters in the key. 
 
The integer output of the XOR operation is then converted back to a character string.

Note: There are certain instances where the XOR of two characters will result in a reserved ASCII value such as an EOF (End of File) or escape character and the string will not be fully decryptable.
