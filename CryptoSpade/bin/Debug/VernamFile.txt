The Vernam Algorithm works by taking an input file.

A key is generated with random data that is the same size as the input file.

This key must be kept secret and must not be lost as it is the only way of decrypting the file.
 
The algorithm then performs an XOR operation on the bytes of the input file with the bytes in the key file. 
 
The output of the XOR operation is the resulting encrypted file.

To decrypt, the encrypted file is specified as well as the key, and the opposite XOR operation is performed and the result is the decrypted file.
