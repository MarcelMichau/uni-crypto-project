The Transposition file encryption algorithm works by taking an input file, and a string key.

It then uses variables such as the file's size and key's length to determine the amount of rows and columns to generate.

The key's alphabetical position is then used to determine the order of the columns and the columns are then transposed to obtain a scrambled array of bytes.

To decrypt, the reverse is performed to obtain the original file.
